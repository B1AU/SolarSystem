# SolarSystem
An interactive solar system simulator created using NASA's Fact-Sheet as a reference for the planets' properties. The main goal of the project is to learn coding in modern C++ through a project that directly benefits me in my future gaols. Also, I am looking for other contributers who have similar interests, which will definitely help in the learning process as well as widen my connections for future projects.
